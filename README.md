# ShrekGame

The program for the Shrek Game features Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey. Shrek and Fiona transform between humans and ogres while Donkey can transform between having a cat in his hand and not having a cat in his hand. 
Shrek bounces off the screen, but Fiona moves through the boundaries and comes back the opposite way (wrapping). The Donkey simply stays still in the middle for the entire game.
When both Fiona and Shrek are ogres and the Donkey has a cat in his hand, then a heart will appear around them, symbolizing their love for one another.
Also, when a character bumps into another character, one random character will transform into the human or ogre or cat or non-cat version of themselves. 
Each interaction includes two choices that could happen.
And that is it! Hope you enjoy my game!
